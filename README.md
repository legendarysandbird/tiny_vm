A tiny virtual machine interpreter for Quack programs

## Work in progress

This is intended to become the core of an interpreter for the Winter 2022
offering of CIS 461/561 compiler construction course at University of Oregon, 
if I can ready it in time. 

## How to use

Run your Quack program like so: "./quack [filename]".
